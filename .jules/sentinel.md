## 2026-04-14 - Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) in Messaging
**Vulnerability:** A Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) vulnerability was found in the `GET /messages/:conversationId` endpoint. Any authenticated user could access the message history of any conversation by providing its `conversationId`, even if they were not a participant.
**Learning:** The route only used the `authenticate` middleware, which ensures the user is logged in but doesn't verify if they have permission to access the specific resource requested.
**Prevention:** Always verify ownership or participation when accessing resources that are not public. Use composite unique constraints in Prisma (like `conversationId_userId`) to efficiently check for participation or access rights.
